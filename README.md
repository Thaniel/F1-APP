## Tools

For the development of the application, JavaScript has been used together with the Vue.js framework, based on the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural
pattern. For the creation of each component of the application, Vuetify.js has been used, another framework highly compatible with Vue.js that follows the Material
Design rules. Also an external API has been used for the automatic updating of the classification fornon-commercial purposes. 

As a database, multimedia content storage system, user authentication management and web hosting service, the services of Firebase, a tool developed by Google as well as Material Design, have been used.
